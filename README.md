### About

Explore The World is an app designed to teach world geography in a fun and engaging way.
It makes use of competative play via a game (expedition) and spaced repetition via its memorization mode to help users
learn the location of countries around the globe.

This version is unfinished and lacking, among other things, textures for models and proper tutorials. Still, the core stuff is there to play with and so we're looking for feedback from friends.

### Features

   - A high quality interactive 3d world map with detailed country information.
    
   - A competative game that teaches geography.
    
   - A guided memorization routine to help students master country locations.
